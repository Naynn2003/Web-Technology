		<h1>Optical Fiber Types</h1>
		<p>An optical fiber is a thin, flexible, transparent fiber that is made of high-quality glass or plastic. The fiber is designed to transmit light signals over long distances with very little attenuation or signal loss. There are several types of optical fibers that are used in various applications.</p>
		<h2>Single-Mode Fiber</h2>
		<p>Single-mode fiber is used for long-distance communication and has a small core diameter of about 8-10 microns. It allows for a single mode of light to propagate through the fiber, which reduces dispersion and attenuation. This type of fiber is ideal for telecommunications, cable television, and internet applications.</p>
		<h2>Multi-Mode Fiber</h2>
		<p>Multi-mode fiber is used for shorter distances and has a larger core diameter of about 50-100 microns. It allows for multiple modes of light to propagate through the fiber, which can cause dispersion and attenuation. This type of fiber is ideal for local area networks and other short-distance applications.</p>
		<h2>Plastic Optical Fiber</h2>
		<p>Plastic optical fiber is made of polymers and has a larger core diameter of about 1 millimeter. It is less expensive than glass fibers and is used for short-distance communication and lighting applications.</p>
